# Tests Documentation

This directory contains test configurations and scripts for validating the Ansible roles in this collection. It includes `Vagrantfile` for setting up virtual machines with different operating systems to ensure compatibility and functionality of the roles (which are installed and configured via Ansible).

> **:bulb: NOTE:** This folder does NOT contain any ansible role code. Here reside only test-related files. So the only ansible code here is in the playbooks used to test the actual roles.
